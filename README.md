# IEEE_Dynamic-Wind-Detection
This repository contains data and scripts for the study Dynamic Wind Condition Detection in Baja California, Mexico. It applies a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to classify wind conditions using meteorological data from La Rumorosa, aiding wind energy forecasting, wildfire risk management, and pollutant dispersion monitoring.
